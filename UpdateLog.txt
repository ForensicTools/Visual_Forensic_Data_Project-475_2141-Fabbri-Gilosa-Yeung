UPDATE 1:
This week our group decided to create the basic function of printing out all directories and files in those directories in a Perl
program. We need to gather all relevant information first before we can start visualizing it, so we are starting out small by just
finding the information first. Next week we will use this information in order to create a visual representation of a file system,
then we will pull statistics from the information in order to find trends or relevant information about a certain user.
