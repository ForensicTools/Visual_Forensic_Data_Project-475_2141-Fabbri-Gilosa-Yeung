Our group spoke with you today in class about bringing together forensic data into a visual form. 
Our group project is to seek out certain or all types of files on a box and visually display the important 
information in a visual format. This is a general outline and is subject to change.

Alessandro Fabbri, Leo Yeung, Peter Gilosa (lyy4768, aaf7044, pxg6044)

Functions of the Project
The main purpose of this project was to visually display the amount of time spent using a certain file or group of files 
in a directory. Another feature that was added to this project is visually representing how many of each type of file can
be found in a certain directory. 

How to Run the Project
There should be an update to the GitHub repository containing two scripts. One of the scripts names Time.pl is used to find out 
the access times for the files in a chosen directory. In order to change the directory in the script there is a value assigned 
to a directory, simple change this value to the directory you want and then run the program. After the program runs a pie chart
will appear is the same directory that the Time.pl script was ran. This graph displays the run times of all the files in the 
selective directory.
In order to access the feature that visually represents what type of files run the Number.pl script in the GitHub repository. 
This program creates a graph that shows how many of each type of file that is found in a given directory. In order to change 
the directory in the script there is a value assigned to a directory, simple change this value to the directory you want and 
then run the program. After the program runs a bar graph will appear is the same directory that the Number.pl script was ran.
All of these features and instructions are subject to change. The most recent update to this project can be found at
